# MQTT with MongoDB

This Node.js project connects to an MQTT broker, captures data from specific topics, and saves it into a MongoDB database. The Node.js project also provides API endpoints for specific queries. This project use Docker container.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- MongoDB (v7 or higher)
- MQTT Broker (such as Mosquitto)
- Docker (optional)
- Docker Compose (optional)

If you are going to run the project with Docker, it is not necessary to install Node.js and MongoDB, the containers already use images with the necessary installations.

## Clone

1. Clone the repository:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/gqferreira/mqtt-mongo.git
 cd mqtt-mongo
 ```

1. Install dependencies (only if you intend to run without Docker):

 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

1. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

 ```ini
 MQTT_URL=mqtt://test.mosquitto.org
 MQTT_PORT=1883
 MQTT_TOPIC=mqtt-mongo
 MQTT_USERNAME=
 MQTT_PASSWORD=
 MONGODB_URI=mongodb://db-telemetry:27017
 MONGODB_DB=iot
 ```

1. Run project (only if you intend to run without Docker):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage with Docker

To start the project, run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose -p telemetry up -d
```

If you are running docker compose on a personal computer locally, you can access the API documentation and interact with it through the following address: `localhost:3001/api-docs`. If you are running on a server, you must use the IP to access and perform the necessary firewall configurations.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Before you can send messages to the brocker intended for a certain channel, you first need to use the API endpoint to create a device with that channel.

If you are running docker compose on a personal computer locally, you can connect to the database (e.g. with NoSQL Booster) at the following address: `localhost:27018`. If you are running on a server, you must use the IP to access and perform the necessary firewall configurations.

If you want to test and don't have an IoT device, you can use the MQTTX app to create a connection to the Mosquitto test brocker and send messages to the channel registered to your device.

To stop the project, run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose -p telemetry down
```

To rebuild after changes if you change Dockerfile (need start again after):
```bash
sudo docker-compose -p telemetry build
```

If you wish, you can access the application container in interactive mode and use PM2 to monitor the application logs:
```bash
docker exec -it app-telemetry bash
pm2 monit
```

If you wish, you can access the database container in interactive mode and use mongosh to query the collections documents.
```bash
docker exec -it db-telemetry bash
mongosh
use iot
```

## Database:

The telemetry collection in the database should be named `telemetry` and have the following structure:
```javascript
use iot

db.telemetry.insertOne(
    {
        "date": ISODate('2024-06-12T10:09:00Z'),
        "light": 3500,
        "temperature": 1900,
        "device": {
            "$ref": "device",
            "$id": ObjectId("000000000000000000000001"),
            "$db": "iot"
        }
    }
);
```

```javascript
db.device.insertOne(
    {
        "channel": 'mqtt-mongo',
        "description": 'Environmental light and temperature monitoring system',
        "status": true
    }
);
```
